# ChatPDF
I made ChatPDF using Langchain which leverages the power of LLMs like LLama, ChatGPT,OpenAssistant and allows the user to upload documents and use them as the knowledge base. Therefore, allowing the user to make any queries about the document which can be a daunting task sometimes. eg summarizing text, explaining certain parts of the document

The app can be found on my Huggingface space. Link : https://huggingface.co/spaces/AeroArtz/ChatPDF
